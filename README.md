# Pig Game with JavaScript
***

## Project Introduction
This game contains 80% JavaScript code. My goal was to learn and internalize DOM in JavaScript. I am really proud of the game because I found it fascinating how extensive JavaScript can be.

## How does the game Work?
1. Roll the Dice as many as you like!
2. If you get a number = 1, then it's the other player's turn.
3. After you reach 100 Points you win.
4. And the last step is to repeat
